# Online-Offline-Budget-Tracker

## Description: 
Tasked with developing a progressive web app capable of receiving and storing transactions, tracking this data, and outputting it in a chart. This app was required to be offline capable with no deterioration of appearance or function. 

## Installation:
The app requires no additional installation and is ready to use at our deployed URL below.
## Instructions:
By inputing a transaction and amount the user simply chooses whether it is an addition or subtraction from the balance. The transaction is then logged, and displayed as well as added to the page chart.

#### Contributing
Instructor provided the class with the db.js file (due to time constraints), and I relied heavily on chapters 18 Activity 18-23 in our cirriculum for this homework.
